# Shooter template

[Shooter](https://github.com/jim-nnamdi/shooter) is a minimalistic template developed in bootstrap for specifically company auctions, and it enables developers to scaffold any project that has to do with auctions easily, facing the technical side of things while the frontend is already set for usage.inspired by [Laravel spark](https://spark.laravel.com/).

## Usage

### Basic Usage

After downloading, simply edit the HTML and CSS files included with the template in your favorite text editor to make changes. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Advanced Usage

After installation, run `npm install` and then run `npm start` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

You must have npm and Gulp installed globally on your machine in order to use these features.
